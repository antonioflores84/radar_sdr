# radar_sdr
This repository is dedicated to educational resources and practical implementations of radar systems using software-defined radio (SDR) technology. It aims to provide a comprehensive learning platform for students, educators, and enthusiasts interested in understanding radar principles, signal processing techniques, and SDR applications.

In this project a CW continuous wave radar is made using sdr, the processing and acquisition of the signals is done using Matlab/Simulink
